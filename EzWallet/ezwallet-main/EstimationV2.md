# Project Estimation - FUTURE
Date:

Version: V2 - description of EZWallet in FUTURE form (as proposed by the team)


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in FUTURE version (as proposed by the team), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   | 18 |
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       | 80 |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1440 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 144 |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 4320 |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 0.9 |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |144|0.9 weeks|
| estimate by product decomposition |134|0.83 weeks|
| estimate by activity decomposition |149|3 weeks|



The estimated duration for the estimate by activity is quite different due to the addition of activities such as feedback collection that need a certain time of period to be collected even if it requires just a few person hours.
It's also a lot higher since the 4 workers may be working on different tasks as well; 13% of their work time has been considered for the estimate by activity
